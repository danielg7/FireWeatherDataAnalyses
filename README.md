# R For Fire Data Science

## Welcome and Instructions

Dear workshop participants-
We are excited to see you at the upcoming workshops on Monday. We want to provide some instructions to you so that you will be prepared for to use the R software language for the exercises. You will need to bring a laptop with R and R studio installed. Please read the instructions below and then follow them.

1. Install R.
You’ll need R version 3.2.0 or higher. Download and install [R for Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), which will be R-3.6.1.pkg, or for [Mac OS X](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), download the latest file, which will be R-3.6.1.pkg or R-3.3.3.pkg, whichever is appropriate for your version of OS X.

2. Install RStudio. 
Download and install the latest stable version of RStudio Desktop: [http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Launch RStudio (RStudio, not R itself). Ensure that you have internet access, then enter the following commands into the Console panel (usually the lower-left panel, by default). Note that these commands are case-sensitive. At any point, R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type "a" at the prompt and hit Enter to update any old packages. If you are using a Windows machine you might get some errors about not having permission to modify the existing libraries – don’t worry about this message. You can avoid this error altogether by running RStudio as an administrator.

Text to enter on the console:
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")

If you are asked at any point during the installations if you want to install developers tools or link to git, just hit "yes." If you run into other kinds of problems during installation, you can write to us with a screenshot of what your computer is showing you as an error, or come in 15 minutes in advance of your session, and we will try to help you. However, if you do not have administrator privileges on the computer you bring in, we may not be able to help you at that point. So please try to install this before you travel, especially if you are using a government computer.

Good luck!
            

## Learning objectives:

### Morning
Learn how to load and reorganize data for analyses in a reproducible way. We will also teach you why reproducible analyses, data storage and metadata are important for the fire sciences

### Afternoon
Make publication-quality graphics for papers and reports, and to share analyses. This is a more advanced session in which we will be teaching participants how to organize and access weather-related data, how to analyze it and present it in graphs, and how to find other resources for more specialized R analyses
